## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Leila Wynn. I'm currently a student at Warren Tech, learning Python and cybersecurity. I am also a student at Rocky Mountain Deaf School as a Junior. My goal is to be a Website designer, and I am passionate about graphic design and website development.
#Git Hub and Visual Studio Code are my tools I use in my program at Warren Tech.
